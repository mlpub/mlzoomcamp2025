# Basic NumPy

## 1.1. Creating Arrays

In NumPy, arrays can be created directly from Python lists or with special functions that generate pre-filled arrays.

Creating from lists:
* 1-dim array, shape (3,)
```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) 
```

* 2-dim array shape (1,3)
```
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3]]) 
```

* 2-dim array, shape (3,1)
```
c = np.array([[1], [2], [3]]) 
```

* 2-dim array shape (2, 3)
```
d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) 
```

* 2-dim array shape (3, 2)
```
e = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) 
```

Note:
np.array([1, 2, 3]) has shape (3,) (1D).



NumPy provides functions for initializing arrays with default values:
* zeros
  ```
  np.zeros(4) # 1D array of 4 zeros, shape (4,)
  np.zeros((2,3)) # 2D array of zeros, shape (2,3)
  ```

* ones
  ```
  np.ones(4) # 1D array of 4 ones
  np.ones((2,3)) # 2D array of ones, shape (2,3)
  ```

* full
  ```
  np.full(1, 4) # 1D array with value 4
  np.full((2,3), 4) # 2D array (2x3) filled with 4
  ```
  The data type is int64. 
  To change to float64, add decimal or set dtype parameter:
  - np.full(1, 4.0) # 1D array float64 by default (4.0)
  - np.full(1, 4, dtype=np.float64) # 1D with value 4.0 explicitly float64

* arange(p1, p2, p3)
  Create an array with start from p1 (default 0), end stop before p2, step size is p3.
  Example: 
  ```
  np.arange(0, 10, 3) # will create array with data start from 0, and step in 3 until before 10.
  array([0, 3, 6, 9])
  ```

* linspace(p1, p2, p3)
  Create an array with start from p1 (default 0), end at p2, with p3 is number of points (include start and end)
  Example:
  ```
  np.linspace(0, 10, 6) # will create array with 6 elements (include 0 and 10 as start and end). So it will contain 4 additional item (so total 6, with start and end).
  array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8., 10.])
  ```

* eye(n, m, k)
  Create identity matrix, with size (n,m). Parameter k is index of the diagonal. if k = 0, main diagonal. k negative, below the main diagonal. k positive, above the main diagonal. 
  Example:
  ```
  np.eye(3, k=0) # will create identity matrix 3x3
  array([[1., 0., 0.],
         [0., 1., 0.],
         [0., 0., 1.]])

  np.eye(3, k=-1) # will create identity matrix 3x3, below the main diagonal
  array([[0., 0., 0.],
         [1., 0., 0.],
         [0., 1., 0.]])

  np.eye(3, k=1) # will create identity matrix 3x3, above the main diagonal
  array([[0., 1., 0.],
         [0., 0., 1.],
         [0., 0., 0.]])
  ```



## 1.2. Arithmetic Operations (+, -, *, /)

In NumPy, arithmetic operations are element-wise. And arrays must have the same shape.
A and B have same shape (4,).
```
A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5])

A+B = [3 5 7 9]
A-B = [-1 -1 -1 -1]
A*B = [ 2  6 12 20]
A/B = [0.5 0.66666667 0.75 0.8 ]
```
When doing arithmetic with a scalar, the operation applies to every element.
Example: A+2, it will add every element in A with 2.
A+2 = [3 4 5 6]


## 1.3. Comparison & Boolean Operations

In NumPy lets you compare arrays element-wise and filter data using boolean masks.
The comparison is done by comparing every elements one by one.

Example:
```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([1, 3, 3])
print(a == b)
[True False True]
```
When comparing a and b, it will check every element, 1==1, 2==3, 3==3. And the result is an array with value true/false.

The comparison operator are:
* Equal, ==
* Not Equal, !=
* Greater, >
* Less, <
* Greater and equal, >=
* Less and equal, <=


### Boolean masking
We can filter an array, using boolean masking, to get the result that is true.
Example, array a contains elements [1,2,3]. And we want to get value that greater than 1.
First, create mask with condition a > 1
```
mask = a > 1
print(mask)
[False True True]
```
Than apply mask into a
```
a1 = a[mask]
print(a1)
[2 3]
```
It keeps only the elements where the condition is True (values greater than 1).


### Logical Operations (&, |, ~)
With logical operations (and &, or |, not ~), we can define multiple condition/filter.
Example
```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```
AND example: values must greater than 2 and less than 5.
```
# create mask
mask = (a > 2) & (a < 5)
a1 = a[mask]
print(a1)
[3 4]
```

OR example: values must less than 3 or greater than 7.
```
mask = (a < 3) | (a > 7)
print(a[mask])   
[1 2 8 9]
```

NOT example: values not greater than 5.
```
mask = ~(a > 5)
print(a[mask])
[1 2 3 4 5]
```


## 1.4. Dot Product
In NumPy, dot product can be calculate using np.dot or @.

Example:
```
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[10, 20], [30, 40]])

np.dot(A,B)
A @ B

[[ 70 100]
 [150 220]]
```


## 1.5. Reshape & Basic Indexing

In NumPy, an array can be reshaped into a different dimension (rows, columns), but the total number of elements must remain the same.
Reshape does not change the data, only how itâ€™s viewed.

Example, original shape is (9,), it can be reshape to (3,3), (9,1), (1,9), (9,1,1) etc.
The product of dimensions must match the original size (9 here).
* (3,3) = 3x3
* (9,1) = 9x1
* (1,9) = 1x9
* (9,1,1) = 9x1x1
```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
a1 = a.reshape(3, 3)
a2 = a.reshape(9, 1)
a3 = a.reshape(1, 9)

a1 = [[1 2 3]
      [4 5 6]
      [7 8 9]]

a2 = [[1]
      [2]
      [3]
      [4]
      [5]
      [6]
      [7]
      [8]
      [9]]

a3 = [[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]]
```

### Basic Indexing
NumPy arrays can be access the elements by using indexing.
The index is start from 0.
1D example:
* Get first element, a[0] ->  Result = 1
* Get third element, a[2] ->  Result = 3
* Get value from index 1-4, a[1:4] ->  Result = [2,3,4]
* Get first 3, a[:3] ->  Result = [1,2,3]
* Get from index 3 until end, a[3:] ->  Result = [4,5,6,7,8,9]

For 2-dim or more, it's same concept with 1-dim.
The same concept works for higher dimensions (3D, 4D, etc.), just add more indexes separated by commas.
Example:
```
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])
```
Array b can be visualize:
```
      Col0  Col1  Col2
Row0   1     2     3
Row1   4     5     6
Row2   7     8     9
```

* Get first row, b[0]
  Result = [1 2 3]
* Get first column, b[:,0]
  Result = [1 4 7]
* Get value of second row (Row1), third column (Col2), b[1,2]
  Result = 6
